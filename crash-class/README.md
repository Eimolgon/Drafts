Dear participant,

You were randomly and undemocratically chosen to contribute in this research.
You will receive a zip file containing 10 short videos of bicycle crashes, your
contribution is to watch and classify them according to the suggested
classification.

The instructions to identfy each type are attached in the .pdf file.
To provide your classification, you need to fill this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOui0qIdRKN9B-s-clTW0cT7iPQqxWdhBqGXqtrk3OD_wCFw/viewform?usp=sharing).
In the case that you feel that one of the videos does not fit into the available
“boxes”, you can describe it with your own terms.

Thanks for your contribution!

Kind regards,
Benjamin
