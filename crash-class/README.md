Bicycle crash classification guide
==================================

How to classify crashes:

## Types of crashes:

1. Pitch-over (P): The sum of forces on the longitudinal direction results in abrupt deceleration, with excessive load transfer that initiates a flip motion with rotation centre on the front wheel.
2. Roll-over: As indicated in the name, mainly related to the roll degree of freedom of the vehicle, it can be sub-divided in two:
    a. Low-side (L): The uncontrolled roll angle increases in the same direction of the intended turning.
    b. High-side (H): The uncontrolled roll angle increases in the opposite direction of the intented turning, as a result of an abrupt change in the tyre-ground surface interaction forces.

Within these categories, we can identify the causes that lead to these crashes, from a dynamics-interesting perspective, which leads to two sub-classes:

1. No external perturbation (0): The start of the crashing motion comes only from the bicycle-dynamics itself and their interaction with the environment without collisions.
2. External perturbation (1): The start of the crash motion comes from an external perturbation, usually an additional force excerted at some point or zone of the human-bicycle system.

Also, we aim to classify the mechanisms that play a major role into these events:

1. Slide: The force excerted on the tyres suddenly reaches the saturation point, changing the moving direction of the tyre.
    a. Front-wheel slide (SF): The front tyre loses grip first.
    b. Rear-wheel slide (SR): The rear tyre loses grip first. This one is a common mechanism for High-side crashes.
2. Braking (B): The user applies the brakes to reduce the speed but the load transfer exceeds the maximum capacity to maintain the riding configuration (2 contact points: one in each wheel) and it leads to the loss of control.
It is important to note that this phenomenon can occur also in acceleration, however, due to low acceleration capabilities of bicycles, this event does not occur in city-riding scenarios.
3. Perturbation: The system collides with an object in its trajectory, excerting an unexpected force:
All of these can be sub-divided in front(f) or rear(r) and longitudinal(lon) or lateral(lat) according to their action point.
Among these perturbations we identify two main types, according to the duration of their application:
    a. Impulsive (I): Perturbations excerted on the system with a duration under 0.5 [s] -> Justify this with the reaction time of the human.
    b. Restrictive (T): Long-duration perturbations that translate into a restriction of one or more degrees of freedom of the system.
4. No-control (N): The human-bicycle system is in a normal riding state but the rider is unable to maintain balance. This category relies mostly on the human factor.


At last, would be useful to identify the intended manoeuvre prior to the crash sequence.

1. Straight-running.
2. Longitudinal acceleration (braking / acceleration).
3. Steady-planned cornering.
4. Start / Stop (Low-speed scenarios).
5. Unplanned turning / avoidance.
